This analysis focuses on exploring and understanding a large dataset of clinical trials registered in the USA. The dataset, sourced from ClinicalTrials.gov, contains over 500,000 records and includes fields such as trial type, study status, funding source, conditions treated, and trial start and end dates. The objective of this task is to extract meaningful insights that could help a pharmaceutical company better understand the market landscape. To achieve this, we employed SQL in Databricks to query the dataset efficiently, taking advantage of SQL's expressiveness and the scalability of Spark SQL. The tasks include summarising the types of clinical trials, identifying common medical conditions, calculating average trial durations, and analyzing trends in diabetes-related trials. Each task is accompanied by a detailed explanation and rationale for the steps taken.
